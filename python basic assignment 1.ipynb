    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello' = string\n",
    "-87.8   = float\n",
    "-       = mathematical operator for subraction\n",
    "/       = mathematical operator for divison which returns numerator\n",
    "+       = mathematical operator for addition\n",
    "6       = integer\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "   . string is a datatype which contains collection of characters or integers or float obejects which are enclosed in a double quote or singe quote for example ('ineuron 1' or \"ineuron 2.0\" )\n",
    "   \n",
    "    . variable is a name which is given to a datatype . we can declare anyname to a variable and can declare a value to it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    . for example( a = \"ineuron\" where 'a' is variable which is assigned with value \"ineuron\" which is string datatype.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   .  we cannot use some predefined keywords as a variable.\n",
    "   \n",
    "     \n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.string is a datatype which contains collection of characters or integers or float obejects which are enclosed in a double quote or singe quote for example ('ineuron 1' or \"ineuron 2.0\" )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.integer is a datatype which can have only real numbers for example(0,1,2,3,4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.float is a datatype which can have numbers with decimal values for example ( 1.5, 2.3, 4.9)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "   . expression is a instruction statement which is made up of operator or value or computation statement which is used for evaluvation. all expressions make some computation works and gives a value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "   . spam = 10 is a assignment satement which only assign's the value 10 in the variable spam and doest not perform any operation and does not return a value where as in expression when it is executed it will return a value.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "the value will be still '22' if it is coded as \"bacon= bacon + 1\" then the output will be 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "    .eggs is just a word which can be used a valid variable and it does not belong to any predefined keyword so it is valid where as 100 is a realnumber and numbers cannot be used as a variable unless it is used in combination of some alphabets for example if we declare as a100=100 then a100 is a valid variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "    .to get integer version of a value we can use this expression   \" variable=int(value) \"\n",
    "    .to get floating-point version of a value we can use this expression \" variable=float(value) \"\n",
    "    .to get string version of a value we can use this expression \" variable=str(value) \"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "   . it will show concatenation error  because it has different datatypes. to fix this error we need all values in same datatypes. we can change datatype of value and this is called typecasting.\n",
    "   \n",
    "the error can be fixed by concatenating the interger value in to string value and below code will fix this error\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + str('99') + ' burritos.'\n",
